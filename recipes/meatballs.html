    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is fabled as "The Best Meatballs", because... well,
            it's exactly that. I mean, just <em>look</em> at that picture! It's 
            hard to dispute that claim, isn't it?
        </p>
        <p>Check out the recipe below to create the <strong>BEST</strong> meatballs
        in your own kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>0.5 pound ground veal</li>
            <li>0.5 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
            <li>1.5 cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)</li>
        </ol>
